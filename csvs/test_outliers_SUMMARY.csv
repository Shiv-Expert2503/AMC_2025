Product Description: Very fruity character inspiring memories of juicy, ripe pears. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste. [A rule of thumb when preparing fresh brewed iced tea is to double the strength of hot tea since it will be poured over ice and diluted with cold water]. Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva. These three high-grown districts produce flavorful teas that have classic &quot;Ceylon&quot; tea character which is noted by floral bouquet and flavor notes, touches of mild astringency, bright coppery col

Product Description: Fresh lemon character that cleanses the palate the way only a lemon can. Try it with a dash of sugar for a summertime snack. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste. [A rule of thumb when preparing fresh brewed iced tea is to double the strength of hot tea since it will be poured over ice and diluted with cold water]. Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva. These three high-grown districts produce flavorful teas that have classic &quot;Ceylon&quot; tea character which is noted by floral bouquet and

When used as a garnish the juice of the Key Lime will brighten any dish or dessert. So when we started producing our flavored teas it didn't take us long to try it in this fabulous blend. The tart and acidic qualities of the Key Lime beautifully compliment the astringent qualities of our high grown Ceylon tea. It goes without saying that this is a truly great dessert tea. - Brew a pot, sit back, and think sunshine. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Must be the top quality Ceylon Tea that may be used! - This tea is designed for special occasions and being a dessert tea - but most drink it all the time because its taste is so delectable. - We know that vanilla is reported to have ""magical"" properties that calm the nerves and lift the spirit and allegedly supporting the romantic aspect of one's life. Indeed, a flavor that is full of mystery and elusiveness. - Do not forget that vanilla was and still is highly prized. On account of this it is quite expensive and in Eastern Africa where the best vanilla is grown, it is not uncommon that vanilla rustling occurs. - Combine the exotic character of vanilla with a velvet cream taste and you end up with the ""Cadillac"" of flavored teas! - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves.

Either way it's delicious. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

In fact, the book's setting of Interzone is loosely based on the dynamic city. - So what draws people to Tangiers?

It's true. The location of the orange's physical origin, however, is up for grabs.

Were you also aware that most species of wild blackberry provide a natural source of cover and food for birds and some mammals? Not only this, but the Himalayan Blackberry is considered a weed! Not all blackberry leaves are deciduous, many remain evergreen and the vines have a tendency to smoother other plant growth. A Himalayan blackberry can be distinguished from other varieties by its five distinctive leaflets. The California blackberry on the other hand has only three leaflets. The wild blackberry plant can live up to 25 years or more. - On the West Coast, blackberries are also known as ""trailing berries"" or ""dew berries."" Enjoy the delicious character of blackberries in this exemplary tea. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil.

Since the first rums were harsh and not so pleasant to drink, it is thought that the name rum actually derived from the old English word rum bullion which means ""great tumult."" - Thankfully, the British refined the drink on their Jamaican plantations during the early part of the 1700's. The result is the smooth sweet liquor we are familiar with today. As for the tea, the blend was probably first consumed by the British sometime shortly after tea blossomed in popularity during the 18th century. - We simply love this tea because it has all the punch of a nice strong rum without any of the after effects. Cheers! - Please note that this tea contains only black tea and natural flavors. This tea does not contain any unhealthy drinks. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea).

Product Description: This fantastic green tea was blended in the spirit of the Velvet Revolution that freed Czechoslovakia from Communist rule in 1989. In that year the students of Prague (Praha in Czech) took to the streets to demand freedom for their nation. The revolution was very peaceful. In fact as far as revolutions go it couldn't have gone any smoother. With not a shot fired, the government conceded defeat to the people and the way was paved for the first democratic election the country had seen in 40 years. To celebrate this important milestone in the history of Prague we've blended this green tea with the natural flavoring of Cassis, a sweet fruity liqueur made from blackcurrants. Cassis was chosen because not only is it delicious, it is a long-standing Czech favorite. Like the liqueur, this tea produces a sweet cup with a full-bodied flavor that is as smooth as the revolution it represents. - The base of the tea is a Sencha style green manufactur - Fantastic currant and smooth green tea flavor - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the pot, cover and let steep for 2-4 minutes. Pour into your cup; add milk and natural sweetener to taste. - Iced tea brewing method: (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 5 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea itself. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into the serving pitcher straining the tea. Add ice and top-up with cold water.

He brought some back to Europe with him and the rest, as they say, is history. - The Pineapple came to be so coveted by European nobility for its sweet flavor and grand appearance that King Charles II of England once posed for an official portrait receiving one as a gift. Pineapples were a big hit in colonial America as well - but early s appeared to prize the fruit more for its appearance than its taste. In some cases merchants even rented them by the day to Southern matrons who would use them to decorate their tables - pineapples being highly regarded as important symbols of hospitality. - Serve this fabulous tea to guests and carry on the tradition. A dash of sugar helps to bring out the natural sweetness of the fruit. Serve over ice for a real Southern delicacy! - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil.

Rooibos is a herb that contains no caffeine. - Rooibos seeds are planted during February and March. They are tended for 18 months after which they are harvested.

Product Description: Apricots an aphrodisiac? The ancient Chinese certainly thought so, and believed that the fruit contained special fertility assisting properties. Could the same be said for Apricot tea? We'll never tell. - What we can tell you is that the apricot was first cultivated in China after fruit bearing trees were discovered growing on the temperate mountain slopes of that country. It's Latin name however, Prunus Armeniaca, owes its root to the fact that the fruit made its way westward via farmers in Armenia. - Eagerly awaited as one of the first fresh fruits of summer, Apricots are noted for their intense fragrance and sweet flavor. Fresh apricots are also a great source of vitamin A. The sweet character of the fruit blends exceptionally with our high grown Ceylon tea and goes well with a dash of sugar. So brew a pot, pour two cups and let the fireworks begin! - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves.

Those of you who have inadvertently tried giving your children drinks that may contain caffeine or large amounts of sugar know that these are hyperactive combinations. You also probably feel a little guilty thinking ""my child should be drinking something that is more healthy and not something that wires them up."" Well, we formulated a Kid's Tea. We theorized that the Herb and Fruit teas are full of natural fruits which are very tasty and refreshing; there are significant amounts of Vitamin C and other essential nutrients in these dried fruits; they are caffeine free .... so all we had to do was make a blend that was appealing to children's taste buds. - This is where real children came in - they became human guinea pigs or perhaps a better term might be ""young tea tasters - Merges caramel with a lemon and strawberry flavor. - Hot tea brewing method: Place 1.5 to 2 teaspoons of Bubblegum Tea per cup (and add 1 teaspoon for the pot) into the teapot. Pour boiling water into pot and let it steep for 5-7 minutes (or longer - the longer the steeping time to more intense the flavor becomes). Pour into your cup and add sugar to taste. **do not add milk - the milk will curdle due to the ingredients in this blend. - Cold tea brewing method: Do Not Pour Hot Liquid directly into a Glass Pitcher. (makes 1 quart/liter) Put 12-15 teaspoons of Bubblegum Tea into a heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5-7 minutes or longer.

It was they who first harvested the plants, chopped them with axes and bruised them with hammers leaving them to ferment before drying in the sun. Rooibos is a herb that contains no caffeine. - Rooibos seeds are planted during February and March. They are tended for 18 months after which they are harvested. Cut Rooibos is bound and milled to a uniform length then bruised between rollers to trigger the fermentation process, which results in the characteristic flavor and sweet aroma. - We then add a full and rich Earl Grey flavoring which gives this Earl Grey Rooibos a classic English taste. - A delicious Earl Grey and rooibos combination - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of Rooibos for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the pot, cover and let steep for 2-4 minutes. Pour into your cup, add milk and natural sweetener to taste. - Iced tea brewing method: (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 5 teaspoons of Rooibos into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

This waterfall is located in the tropical jungles of Venezuela and drops over 2000 feet.

Pour boiling water into pot and let it steep for 5-7 minutes (or longer - the longer the steeping time to more intense the flavor becomes). Pour into your cup and add sugar to taste. **do not add milk - the milk will curdle due to the ingredients in this blend. - Cold tea brewing method: Do Not Pour Hot Liquid directly into a Glass Pitcher. (makes 1 quart/liter) Put 12-15 teaspoons of Angel Falls Mist into a heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5-7 minutes or longer.

They are actually native to China. - Chinese nobility called them Yang Tao and prized them for their dazzling flavor and royal emerald color. The fuzzy fruit with the sweet green pulp (Latin: Actinidia chinensis) was first brought to New Zealand in 1906. - A few years later a horticulturalist named Hayward Wright cultivated the commercial kiwi fruit that is now exported all over the globe. The fruit was originally marketed, with little success, under the name ""Chinese Gooseberry."" It was decided that for advertising purposes the fruit needed a more memorable name and so the name of New Zealand's national bird was chosen - Kiwi. - It is difficult to describe the fruit's sweet flavor. It is probably best summed up as having a delicate ""multi-fruit"" character - mild, and sweet, not too tart. It is not difficult to sum up the flavor of this tea however. One word can do that: absolutelycompletelyd - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Must be the top quality Ceylon Tea that may be used! - This tea is designed for special occasions and being a dessert tea - but most drink it all the time because its taste is so delectable. - We know that vanilla is reported to have ""magical"" properties that calm the nerves and lift the spirit and allegedly supporting the romantic aspect of one's life. Indeed, a flavor that is full of mystery and elusiveness. - Do not forget that vanilla was and still is highly prized. On account of this it is quite expensive and in Eastern Africa where the best vanilla is grown, it is not uncommon that vanilla rustling occurs. - Combine the exotic character of vanilla with a velvet cream taste and you end up with the ""Cadillac"" of flavored teas! - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves.

They are actually native to China. - Chinese nobility called them Yang Tao and prized them for their dazzling flavor and royal emerald color. The fuzzy fruit with the sweet green pulp (Latin: Actinidia chinensis) was first brought to New Zealand in 1906. - A few years later a horticulturalist named Hayward Wright cultivated the commercial kiwi fruit that is now exported all over the globe. The fruit was originally marketed, with little success, under the name ""Chinese Gooseberry."" It was decided that for advertising purposes the fruit needed a more memorable name and so the name of New Zealand's national bird was chosen - Kiwi. - It is difficult to describe the fruit's sweet flavor. It is probably best summed up as having a delicate ""multi-fruit"" character - mild, and sweet, not too tart. It is not difficult to sum up the flavor of this tea however. One word can do that: absolutelycompletelyd - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Product Description: A mellow tropical fruit character that has sweet overtones. Ancient Polynesians held passion fruit in high regard for their rituals. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste. [A rule of thumb when preparing fresh brewed iced tea is to double the strength of hot tea since it will be poured over ice and diluted with cold water]. Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva.

(We have tested teas from various other origins around the world as base stock for our flavored teas, but none of these teas made the grade. We may pay more for high grown Ceylons, but the taste is worth it). - Dimbula and the western estates of Nuwara Eliya have a major quality peak during Jan/Feb, whereas Uva and the eastern estates of Nuwara Eliya have their peak in July/Aug. This &quot;dual peak period&quot; allows us to buy the best for our flavored tea blends several times during the year, ensuring top quality and freshness. - Secondly...we use flavoring oils not crystals to give the tea drinker an olfactory holiday before indulging in the liquid tea d

Product Description: Piquant and fruity raspberry notes. The distinctive arctic raspberry is very flavorful because of it's short growing season. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste.

Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva. These three high-grown districts produce flavorful teas that have classic &quot;Ceylon&quot; tea character which is noted by floral bouquet and

But did you know that Italy consumes more pears than any other European nation? Did you know that after China, Italy is the world's second largest grower of pears? It's true! Italians have been enjoying pears since the early days of ancient Rome. Pears hold a special place in their hearts not just because of their delicious flavor, but because they are wonderful to cook with and to pair with other foods.

Tuscan chefs have created many recipes over the years, and routinely whip up such delicacies as pears poached in white wine, sliced pears with fresh Parmesan cheese or spicy pear pastries. - The slightly tart, highly adaptable flavor of Italian pears is perfectly complimented by their high nutrient content. Pears are high in fiber, vitamin c, p - Sweet pear notes marry well with premium rooibos - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil.

It was they who first harvested the plants, chopped them with axes and bruised them with hammers leaving them to ferment before drying in the sun. Rooibos is a herb that contains no caffeine. - Rooibos seeds are planted during February and March. They are tended for 18 months after which they are harvested. Cut Rooibos is bound and milled to a uniform length then bruised between rollers to trigger the fermentation process, which results in the characteristic flavor and sweet aroma. - We then add a full and rich Earl Grey flavoring which gives this Earl Grey Rooibos a classic English taste. - A delicious Earl Grey and rooibos combination - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil.

Vanilla is the only edible fruit of the orchid family, likely the world's largest flowering genus. There are two types of vanilla that may be used for commercial purposes - Honeydew and Tahitian. It is the worlds most labor intensive agricultural crop, taking up to three years after the vines are planted, before the first flowers appear. - Vanilla has a long history of robbery and intrigue as it is very expensive and highly prized and in growing countries it is not uncommon for vanilla rustling to occur. As there are about 150 varieties of vanilla, it is certainly a flavoring agent that is suited to one's personal tastes. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Product Description: The Pineapple is native to southern Brazil and Paraguay. It was first discovered in November, 1493, by Christopher Columbus, (is there anything he didn't discover?!) He brought some back to Europe with him and the rest, as they say, is history. - The Pineapple came to be so coveted by European nobility for its sweet flavor and grand appearance that King Charles II of England once posed for an official portrait receiving one as a gift. Pineapples were a big hit in colonial America as well - but early s appeared to prize the fruit more for its appearance than its taste. In some cases merchants even rented them by the day to Southern matrons who would use them to decorate their tables - pineapples being highly regarded as important symbols of hospitality. - Serve this fabulous tea to guests and carry on the tradition. A dash of sugar helps to bring out the natural sweetness of the fruit. Serve over ice for a real Southern delicacy! - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.
