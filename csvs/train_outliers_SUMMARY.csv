Product Description: Raspberries have been enjoyed as a delicacy in Bohemia, a region of the Czech Republic, since at least the 900's. One need only drive a little way outside of Prague to find wild bushes lining many of the roadsides that wind their way through the countryside. These sweet little berries were purportedly the favorite of Boleslav I, the first King of Bohemia. Unfortunately, old King Boleslav, also known as Boleslav the Cruel, murdered his own brother St. Wenceslas. The murder allowed Boleslav to take the throne and was committed at a family feast - some family! - Given the kings fondness for raspberries, there is no doubt that along with murder, the fruit was also served. It is too bad Bohemian Raspberry green tea wasn't also available - it may have relaxed the man a little. This blend, with its mellow grassy undertones and sweet raspberry notes, is one of our most soothing greens yet. - Bohemian Raspberry is based on a Sencha style green t - Refreshing raspberry with smooth green tea notes - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the pot, cover and let steep for 2-4 minutes. Pour into your cup; add milk and natural sweetener to taste. - Iced tea brewing method: (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 5 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea itself. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into the serving pitcher straining the tea.

Even when fresh cold drinking water cannot be found, you will inevitably encounter a chai-wallah, or chai seller, yelling out, ""chayee! chayee!"" - While riding the rails in India, the call of the chai wallah can be heard at every stop proffering their delicious hot drink. It is not uncommon for a chai-wallah to board a train in the middle of the night and wake up passengers to sell chai. The chai arrives in small clay cups that customers throw from the train windows when finished! - Indian chai is typically made using a rich black tea, usually an Assam, and brewing it in heavy milk with cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and pepper. The drink produces a warm soothing effect and engenders a wonderfully calming effect on the body. We've taken the soothing aspect of this blend one step furth - Creamy Madagascar vanilla notes combined with Malabar Coast spices - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 heaping teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 5-10 minutes (for true &quot;chayee chayee&quot; steep at least 7 minutes). While the tea is brewing prepare your cup to receive the chai - put 2 teaspoons of sugar in the cup and add milk (about 20%) of the cup's volume. When the chai is ready - pour into your cup. - Iced tea brewing method: (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Product Description: Herb and fruit tea in some circles is considered a new type of tea. We formulated this blend to accommodate tastes of people who wanted to experience a refreshing healthy new style drink without caffeine. What we got was a terrific ""tea"" that is unbelievably delicious and enjoyed Hot or Cold! This tea has a very exotic flavor profile. The delicious blend of strawberry and kiwi flavors combined with the natural flavors and tartness of the various dried fruits create a summertime cooler or a wintertime summer reminder. - This fruit and herb tea is one of our favorites. It is a full flavored tea with good body. During the spring in the northern latitudes when the strawberries become available they have a deep strawberry taste. This tea is like that but tempered with subtle essence of kiwi and the astringent tartness of hibiscus. We remember a holiday in Long Island picking strawberries at a ""Pick Your Own"" out in The Hamptons, very pleasan - Wonderfully fruity and full bodied with excellent flavor - Hot tea brewing method: Place 1.5 to 2 teaspoons of Strawberry Kiwi per cup (and add 1 teaspoon for the pot) into the teapot. Pour boiling water into pot and let it steep for 5-7 minutes (or longer - the longer the steeping time to more intense the flavor becomes). Pour into your cup and add sugar to taste. **do not add milk - the milk will curdle due to the ingredients in this blend. - Cold tea brewing method: Do Not Pour Hot Liquid directly into a Glass Pitcher.

Even when fresh cold drinking water cannot be found, you will inevitably encounter a chai-wallah, or chai seller, yelling out, ""chayee! chayee!"" - While riding the rails in India, the call of the chai wallah can be heard at every stop proffering their delicious hot drink. It is not uncommon for a chai-wallah to board a train in the middle of the night and wake up passengers to sell chai. The chai arrives in small clay cups that customers throw from the train windows when finished! - Indian chai is typically made using a rich black tea, usually an Assam, and brewing it in heavy milk with cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and pepper. The drink produces a warm soothing effect and engenders a wonderfully calming effect on the body. We've taken the soothing aspect of this blend one step furth - Creamy Madagascar vanilla notes combined with Malabar Coast spices - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 heaping teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 5-10 minutes (for true &quot;chayee chayee&quot; steep at least 7 minutes). While the tea is brewing prepare your cup to receive the chai - put 2 teaspoons of sugar in the cup and add milk (about 20%) of the cup's volume. When the chai is ready - pour into your cup. - Iced tea brewing method: (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice,

Product Description: Vanilla is an extraordinary flavor that is full of mystery and elusiveness that is often taken for granted. Undoubtedly one of life little secrets, widely used in health concoctions to make them more palatable. Vanilla is the only edible fruit of the orchid family, likely the world's largest flowering genus. There are two types of vanilla that may be used for commercial purposes - Honeydew and Tahitian. It is the worlds most labor intensive agricultural crop, taking up to three years after the vines are planted, before the first flowers appear. - Vanilla has a long history of robbery and intrigue as it is very expensive and highly prized and in growing countries it is not uncommon for vanilla rustling to occur. As there are about 150 varieties of vanilla, it is certainly a flavoring agent that is suited to one's personal tastes. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves.

They are actually native to China. - Chinese nobility called them Yang Tao and prized them for their dazzling flavor and royal emerald color. The fuzzy fruit with the sweet green pulp (Latin: Actinidia chinensis) was first brought to New Zealand in 1906. - A few years later a horticulturalist named Hayward Wright cultivated the commercial kiwi fruit that is now exported all over the globe. The fruit was originally marketed, with little success, under the name ""Chinese Gooseberry."" It was decided that for advertising purposes the fruit needed a more memorable name and so the name of New Zealand's national bird was chosen - Kiwi. - It is difficult to describe the fruit's sweet flavor. It is probably best summed up as having a delicate ""multi-fruit"" character - mild, and sweet, not too tart. It is not difficult to sum up the flavor of this tea however. One word can do that: absolutelycompletelyd - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

In that year the students of Prague (Praha in Czech) took to the streets to demand freedom for their nation. The revolution was very peaceful. In fact as far as revolutions go it couldn't have gone any smoother. With not a shot fired, the government conceded defeat to the people and the way was paved for the first democratic election the country had seen in 40 years. To celebrate this important milestone in the history of Prague we've blended this green tea with the natural flavoring of Cassis, a sweet fruity liqueur made from blackcurrants. Cassis was chosen because not only is it delicious, it is a long-standing Czech favorite. Like the liqueur, this tea produces a sweet cup with a full-bodied flavor that is as smooth as the revolution it represents. - The base of the tea is a Sencha style green manufactur - Fantastic currant and smooth green tea flavor - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil.

Product Description: Enjoy mellow and sweet lemon notes with the full malty character of vanilla. A delicacy to savor by the roaring fire. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste. [A rule of thumb when preparing fresh brewed iced tea is to double the strength of hot tea since it will be poured over ice and diluted with cold water]. Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva. These three high-grown districts produce flavorful teas that have classic &quot;Ceylon&quot; tea character which is noted by floral bouquet and flavor

Product Description: The full astringent taste of rum mellowed with a creamy smoothness. - Please note that this tea contains only black tea and natural flavors. This tea does not contain any unhealthy drinks. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste.

Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva.

Bullet Point 1: ✔️Raw Whole Seeds
Bullet Point 2: ✔️Highest Quality, Highest Purity
Bullet Point 3: ✔️Amazing little seeds with great health benefits. Indeed, the seeds indeed are the storehouse for many vital vitamins. Vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C as well as many B-complex vitamins like thiamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin and niacin particularly are concentrated in these seeds.
Bullet Point 4: ✔️Fennel seed has been recognized as one of nine Anglo-Saxon sacred herbs for its health benefits. The spice is one of the most sought-after ingredients in many popular cuisines all over the Mediterranean regions.
Bullet Point 5: ✔️Many cultures in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East use fennel seed in their cookery. It is one of the most important spices in Kashmiri Pandit and Gujarati cooking.
Product Description: <br>Fennel is a plant that belongs to the parsley family. It comes to us from the Mediterranean, but it’s so undemanding in its environment that today it’s cultivated almost all over the world. This herb is widely used in cooking due to its rich flavor and aroma that are very similar to anise. <br><br><br>Nutritional Value <br><br>In order to truly appreciate fennel nutrition benefits, you need to know how many nutrients its seeds contain and in what quantities. 3.5 ounces of dried fennel seeds have: <br><br><br>39g fiber <br>21mg vitamin C <br>135IU vitamin A <br>1196mg calcium <br>18.5mg iron <br>487mg phosphorus <br>1.067mg copper <br>6.533mg manganese <br>385mg magnesium <br>3.70mg zinc <br><br>Of course, eating 3.5 ounces of fennel seeds in one go is impossible and would definitely classify as ‘too much’. However, adding small amounts of them to your diet would allow you to get a fraction of all these essential elements while enjoying the fantastic flavor and taste of this spice. <br><br>Vegans and vegetarians should appreciate the high iron content of fennel seeds more than most people because it’s hard to plan a plant-based diet that would contain sufficient amounts of this element. Note that an adult man requires about 10mg iron a day, while women need at least 15mg. Every pinch of fennel seeds in your salad helps you achieve this daily requirement in a natural way. <br><br><br>How to Eat <br><br>As fennel seeds are a spice, you can use them as any other spice, flavoring a great variety of dishes. If you really love the taste, you can try eating roasted fennel seeds as a snack. They are crunchy and rather sweet. Just remember to indulge in this treat in moderation. <br><br>Fennel seeds are a perfect spice for marinades of any kind. <br><br>Fennel Seeds should be stored in an airtight container. Keep them in a cool dark place and away from foods that may absorb their aroma. Grind them right before use.

Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste.

Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva. These three high-grown districts produce flavorful teas that have classic &quot;Ceylon&quot; tea character which is noted by floral bouquet and flavor

(To date however, no new name has been chosen!) - Beyond Puerto Rico, the soursap tree has been harvested in the Caribbean since at least 1526 when Spanish explorers first took note of the large fruits. And when we say large, we mean large. The weight of a ripe soursap is generally in the range of 10-15 lbs! Plus, the outer skin of the fruit is covered in spikes that make it look something like the skin of a blowfish - yikes! Luckily, the inside of the fruit is pulpy and juicy with a pleasantly sweet acidic flavor. This unique fruit blends magnificently with our high grown Ceylon so go ahead, brew a pot, and get creative. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Rum, made by processing fermented sugar cane, was first produced by British colonizers in Barbados sometime in the mid-17th century. Since the first rums were harsh and not so pleasant to drink, it is thought that the name rum actually derived from the old English word rum bullion which means ""great tumult."" - Thankfully, the British refined the drink on their Jamaican plantations during the early part of the 1700's. The result is the smooth sweet liquor we are familiar with today. As for the tea, the blend was probably first consumed by the British sometime shortly after tea blossomed in popularity during the 18th century. - We simply love this tea because it has all the punch of a nice strong rum without any of the after effects. Cheers! - Please note that this tea contains only black tea and natural flavors. This tea does not contain any unhealthy drinks. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Fresh apricots are also a great source of vitamin A. The sweet character of the fruit blends exceptionally with our high grown Ceylon tea and goes well with a dash of sugar. So brew a pot, pour two cups and let the fireworks begin! - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher.

Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste. [A rule of thumb when preparing fresh brewed iced tea is to double the strength of hot tea since it will be poured over ice and diluted with cold water]. Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva. These three high-grown districts produce flavorful teas that have classic &quot;Ceylon&quot; tea character which is noted by floral bouquet and flavor notes, t

Product Description: Herb and fruit tea in some circles is considered a new type of tea. We formulated this blend to accommodate tastes of people who wanted to experience a refreshing healthy new style drink without caffeine. What we got was a terrific ""tea"" that is unbelievably delicious and enjoyed Hot or Cold! This tea has a very exotic flavor profile. The delicious blend of strawberry and kiwi flavors combined with the natural flavors and tartness of the various dried fruits create a summertime cooler or a wintertime summer reminder. - This fruit and herb tea is one of our favorites. It is a full flavored tea with good body. During the spring in the northern latitudes when the strawberries become available they have a deep strawberry taste. This tea is like that but tempered with subtle essence of kiwi and the astringent tartness of hibiscus. We remember a holiday in Long Island picking strawberries at a ""Pick Your Own"" out in The Hamptons, very pleasan - Wonderfully fruity and full bodied with excellent flavor - Hot tea brewing method: Place 1.5 to 2 teaspoons of Strawberry Kiwi per cup (and add 1 teaspoon for the pot) into the teapot. Pour boiling water into pot and let it steep for 5-7 minutes (or longer - the longer the steeping time to more intense the flavor becomes). Pour into your cup and add sugar to taste. **do not add milk - the milk will curdle due to the ingredients in this blend. - Cold tea brewing method: Do Not Pour Hot Liquid directly into a Glass Pitcher. (makes 1 quart/liter) Put 12-15 teaspoons of Strawberry Kiwi into a heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5-7 minutes or longer. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into the pitcher straining the ingredients. Add ice and top-up with cold water.

For centuries this Northern Moroccan city has been home to colorful characters from all walks of life. From pirates to traders, writers, painters and eccentric millionaires, the ancient city has seen it all. During the 1940s and 50s, Tangiers was considered an International Zone and as the cold war began to heat up, even served as a major meeting point for international spies and weapons dealers. It was during this time that beatnik author William S. Burroughs set up shop to write his famous novel, Naked Lunch. In fact, the book's setting of Interzone is loosely based on the dynamic city. - So what draws people to Tangiers? One is its location at the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic. Another is its sultry climate. Yet another is its fantastic cuisine, which leans heavily on spice and fresh fruit, including l - Exquisite lemon notes combined with white tea that lends a lovely sweetness to the cup - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil.

Bullet Point 1: ✔️Raw Whole Seeds
Bullet Point 2: ✔️Highest Quality, Highest Purity
Bullet Point 3: ✔️Amazing little seeds with great health benefits. Indeed, the seeds indeed are the storehouse for many vital vitamins. Vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C as well as many B-complex vitamins like thiamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin and niacin particularly are concentrated in these seeds.
Bullet Point 4: ✔️Fennel seed has been recognized as one of nine Anglo-Saxon sacred herbs for its health benefits. The spice is one of the most sought-after ingredients in many popular cuisines all over the Mediterranean regions.
Bullet Point 5: ✔️Many cultures in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East use fennel seed in their cookery. It is one of the most important spices in Kashmiri Pandit and Gujarati cooking.
Product Description: <br>Fennel is a plant that belongs to the parsley family. It comes to us from the Mediterranean, but it’s so undemanding in its environment that today it’s cultivated almost all over the world. This herb is widely used in cooking due to its rich flavor and aroma that are very similar to anise. <br><br><br>Nutritional Value <br><br>In order to truly appreciate fennel nutrition benefits, you need to know how many nutrients its seeds contain and in what quantities. 3.5 ounces of dried fennel seeds have: <br><br><br>39g fiber <br>21mg vitamin C <br>135IU vitamin A <br>1196mg calcium <br>18.5mg iron <br>487mg phosphorus <br>1.067mg copper <br>6.533mg manganese <br>385mg magnesium <br>3.70mg zinc <br><br>Of course, eating 3.5 ounces of fennel seeds in one go is impossible and would definitely classify as ‘too much’. However, adding small amounts of them to your diet would allow you to get a fraction of all these essential elements while enjoying the fantastic flavor and taste of this spice. <br><br>Vegans and vegetarians should appreciate the high iron content of fennel seeds more than most people because it’s hard to plan a plant-based diet that would contain sufficient amounts of this element. Note that an adult man requires about 10mg iron a day, while women need at least 15mg. Every pinch of fennel seeds in your salad helps you achieve this daily requirement in a natural way. <br><br><br>How to Eat <br><br>As fennel seeds are a spice, you can use them as any other spice, flavoring a great variety of dishes. If you really love the taste, you can try eating roasted fennel seeds as a snack. They are crunchy and rather sweet. Just remember to indulge in this treat in moderation. <br><br>Fennel seeds are a perfect spice for marinades of any kind. <br><br>Fennel Seeds should be stored in an airtight container. Keep them in a cool dark place and away from foods that may absorb their aroma. Grind them right before use.
